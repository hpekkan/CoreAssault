## Development Challenges and Solutions

During the development of my game, I encountered several challenges that required creative problem-solving. Here are the major difficulties I faced and how I overcame them:

1. Learning Raycasting in Unity: Mastering raycasting was initially challenging, but I persevered through extensive self-study, documentation research, and practical exercises.

2. Managing PlayerPrefs for Variable Storage: Effectively handling PlayerPrefs for variable storage demanded careful organization and judicious usage.

3. Creating a Radar System: Implementing the radar system involved thoughtful design, employing a dedicated top-down camera and layer-based categorization.

4. Handling Player and Weapon Swapping: Ensuring seamless swapping between characters and weapons required a unified coordinate system and a modular animation approach.
   
By overcoming these challenges, I improved the overall quality and functionality of my game. Each hurdle presented an opportunity for growth and learning, ultimately resulting in a more polished and enjoyable gaming experience.
