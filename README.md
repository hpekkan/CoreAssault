## Development Challenges and Solutions

During the development of my game, I encountered several challenges that required creative problem-solving. Here are the major difficulties I faced and how I overcame them:

1. Limited Character Package and Animation Requirements: When I found a low-poly character for my game, I realized that the package didn't meet homework's animation needs. To address this, I researched and discovered the Maximo.com. By importing and integrating Maximo animations into game, I enhanced the character's movements and made them more dynamic and engaging.

2. Understanding Local Spaces for Carrying Objects: I wanted to implement a mechanic where the player could carry a barrel. However, I had to figure out how local spaces worked to ensure the barrel interacted properly with the character's movements. Through experimentation and learning, I gained a solid understanding of local spaces and successfully synchronized the barrel's position and orientation with the character's actions, creating a seamless interaction.

3. Utilizing TextMesh for In-Game Text: Implementing in-game text required finding a suitable solution. I had to learn how to use TextMesh effectively to display text within my game environment. By studying its features and experimenting with different settings, I integrated TextMesh into my game, allowing for the display of relevant information and enhancing player understanding.
4. Learning Animator Workings and Creating Logics: Throughout the development process, I had to learn how animators work and how to create logical systems that govern various aspects of the game. This included understanding animation states, transitions, and parameter-driven behaviors. By studying documentation, tutorials, and experimenting with different approaches, I acquired the necessary knowledge to create complex animations and design logical systems to control character behavior.
   
By overcoming these challenges, I improved the overall quality and functionality of my game. Each hurdle presented an opportunity for growth and learning, ultimately resulting in a more polished and enjoyable gaming experience.
